# About

nsync is a redis master/slave replication client written in Erlang. When the nsync process starts, it opens a tcp socket connected to the master redis server and issues a "SYNC" command.  The redis master asynchronously dumps its dataset to disk and transfers it to the nsync slave as an rdb dump.  The master then streams subsequent updates to the slave using the redis text protocol.
